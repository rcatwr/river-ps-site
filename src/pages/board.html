          <h3>Board of Directors</h3>

          <p><strong>Sara Wilson  (Chair)</strong>
             is passionate about parenting, healthy children, reconciliation with Canada's Indigenous peoples, healthy communities and life long learning. Although her children are now school age, she believes that whole and healthy education for children starts early and is an important foundation for a person's life in society which drives her interest in the River Preschool. Sara has volunteered on the board of the Victoria Waldorf Society over 10 years, volunteers through St. Barnabas Church's community initiatives (notably was a core part of the Refugee Committee) and volunteers at her children's school as PAC treasurer.

          <p><strong>Heidi Teel  (Co-chair) </strong>
            is a parishioner of St. Barnabas and a homeschooling parent who has
            long appreciated the natural arts and crafts materials used in the daily
            and seasonal patterns of a Waldorf-inspired childhood, patterns that fit
            so beautifully into the broader picture of a liturgical church.  She has
            also co-authored the book, A Time to Read:  Good Books for Growing
            Readers, and she is passionate about giving children a childhood that
            includes lots of outdoor time, creative play, and chances to find their
            place in 'The Story.'
          </p>
          <p><strong>Bonnie Stacy   (Secretary)</strong>
              is a retired educator having spent most of her 37 professional years teaching at the early primary grade level.  For the last 15 years of her teaching profession she was an Elementary Vice Principal and Principal.  She volunteered to serve on the board of directors as she thought her past experience might be of some benefit to the opening of The River Preschool.  Bonnie strongly believes that a faith-based and Waldorf-inspired approach to a child's early experiences will give them a solid foundation in which to go forth in their future years.
