            <h5>The River Preschool: Christian faith-based and Waldorf Inspired</h5>
              <p>At the River Preschool, we recognize and welcome with reverence the unique gifts brought by each child we serve.  We believe that preschool aged children are laying their lifelong foundation. Our play-based program will support the children’s physical, emotional and spiritual development on their individual path. We will help them lay a foundation of imagination, life-skill, respect, gratitude, and curiosity for each other and for God’s great creation in the natural world.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that healthy early childhood development will unfold fully in the context of healthy social relationships among parents, teachers and children. The River Preschool joins together with the community of St. Barnabas, a Christian church in the Anglican tradition, to create a warm and joyful space for preschoolers and their families.
