          <p><strong>Head Teacher (ECE) Sarah Oliver</strong></p>


            <p>Since graduating from the University of Guelph, Ontario, with a Bachelor of
            Applied Science in Child Studies, Sarah has had over 15 years of experience working
            with children, families and care providers in a variety of settings including Waldorf
            schools, non-profit organizations, preschools, childcare centres and summer
            camps.</p>

            <p>Sarah started the After-School Care Program at Trillium Waldorf School in
            Guelph and was a frequent supply teacher in the Parent and Child program,
            kindergarten, and grades 1 through 8. At Waldorf Academy in Toronto, she was
            the Lead Teacher of the Sky Garden Preschool Class at the Childcare Centre.
            In 2016 Sarah moved from Ontario to Victoria, and she definitely does not miss
            the snow. She enjoys making art, handicrafts, gardening, cooking, photography
            and spending time outdoors getting to know the plants and animals.
